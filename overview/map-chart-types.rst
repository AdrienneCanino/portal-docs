Chart Types

This section includes descriptions for the common charts used to display data in the portal. Data charts can be accessed both by clicking a point on a data layer in the map, or by using the custom Data Views interface.

Categorical Variables
---------------------

* **Bar charts:** compare the size or frequency of different categories. Since the values of a categorical variable are labels for the categories, the distribution of a categorical variable gives either the count or the percent of individuals falling into each category.

Quantitative Variables
----------------------

* **Line charts:** display points connecting the data to show a continuous change over time. In the map, the line chart shows the current values together with historical statistics. The x-axis shows the occurrences and the categories being compared over time and the y-axis represents the scale, which is a set of numbers organized into equal intervals.

* **Histograms:** show the frequency of distribution for the observations. A histogram is constructed by representing the measurements or observations that are grouped on a horizontal scale, the interval frequencies on a vertical scale, and drawing rectangles whose bases equal the class intervals and whose heights are determined by the corresponding class frequencies.

.. tip:: In the portal, histogram charts can be created across custom areas of interest using the polygon tool.

* **Box plots:** are useful for identifying outliers and for comparing distributions. The boxplot is a graph of a five-number summary: the minimum score, first quartile (Q1-the median of the lower half of all scores), the median, third quartile (Q3-the median of the upper half of all scores), and the maximum score. The boxplot consists of a rectangular box, which represents the middle half of all scores (between Q1 and Q3). Approximately one-fourth of the values should fall between the minimum and Q1, and approximately one-fourth should fall between Q3 and the maximum. A line in the box marks the median. Lines called whiskers extend from the box out to the minimum and maximum scores.

* **Dot plots:** consist of data points plotted on a fairly simple scale. Dot plots are suitable for small to moderate sized data sets to highlight clusters and gaps, as well as outliers. When dealing with larger data sets (around 20â€“30 or more data points) the box plot or histogram may be more efficient, as dot plots may become too cluttered after this point.

* **Curtain plots:** show a visual summary of vertical profiling data. f data is available at depth, the chart will show depth on the y-axis with the values represented by colors.
