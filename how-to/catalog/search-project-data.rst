The `Research Workspace <https://researchworkspace.com/intro/>`_ is a gateway to make project-based research data available publicly through the portal.

To search for project data in the catalog, click on the ``Result types`` icons to remove Data Layers and Sensor Stations and show only Projects. Both the Data Layers and Sensor Stations icons will be grayed out and show a plus sign |plus_icon|. The Projects icon will remain dark and show a minus sign |minus_icon|.

From here, select the dataset you'd like to view or download by clicking on its title.

For more information about publishing data to the portal from the Research Workspace, please see the :ref:`contributing-data-overview` section and the `Research Workspace help documentation <https://researchworkspace.com/help/PublishingData.html>`_.
