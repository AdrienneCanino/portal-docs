From the |title| home page, click on ``Explore Data Layers`` to navigate to the catalog.

Within the catalog, you will find a listing of all the data layers accessible through the |title|. By default, the data layers are shown in alphabetical order. There are several ways the data layers can be browsed or searched.

* Click a category tag in the left sidebar. The data layers that are associated with the tag will be displayed. More than one category tag can be selected at the same time.

* Enter a search term. Just type the data you are interested in finding into the search box in the upper left toolbar. As you type, you may see matching terms (e.g. ``Hints``) and actual data layers (e.g. ``Results``) appear below the toolbar's search box. Click on the ``Hints`` or ``Results`` of interest and the search results will appear in the data catalog.

* Filter the result types in the left sidebar. All data layers in the catalog are categorized as ``Map layers`` (e.g. static GIS layers), ``Projects`` (e.g. research project data files displayed from the Research Workspace), or ``Sensor stations`` (e.g. real-time sensor observations). Select the checkboxes to display or narrow the data layers by these ``Results`` types.

* Do an advanced search by space, time, or method. Click on ``Advanced search options`` in the left sidebar.

	* Using the ``Spatial filter`` option, you can click on the rectangle icon to draw a bounding box on the map, or you can type the latitude/longitude coordinates. The data layers occuring in that spatial area will appear in the data catalog.

	* Using the ``Filter time`` option, you can adjust the time slider or type the start/end date range. The data layers occuring during that temporal period will appear in the data catalog.

	* Using the ``Access method`` option, you can select data service method from which data layers can be downloaded from the catalog.
