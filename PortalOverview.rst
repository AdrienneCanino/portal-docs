Portal Overview
###############

The portal is a data exploration tool with a customized public web interface that allows scientists, managers, and the general public to discover and access public data from many sources. The portal has two components: 1) data catalog and 2) map interface.
The catalog provides a way to explore available datasets using text searches and filters, as well as the ability to download datasets of interest. Some datasets in the catalog can be visualized automatically through the portal's map interface, which provides a rich suite of tools for creating charts, comparing data, and visualizing datasets in context.

************
Data Catalog
************

The catalog provides search access for all datasets within the portal. The catalog can be used to discover, browse, and download data files. Additionally, the catalog can be used to add visualizable data layers to the Portal Map View. The catalog contains several observational data types:

* *Real-time data* are ingested, served, and displayed by the portal at the same frequency the data are collected (and sometimes reported) by the originator with little to no delay. Examples of real-time assets include weather stations, oceanographic buoys, and webcams.

* *Near real-time data* are ingested by the portal at the same frequency that the data are made available; however, there is some delay (hours to days) between data collection and when the data provider makes it available. Examples of near real-time assets include satellite images and derived satellite products.

* *Historical data* are data that are one month old or older. Historical data are ingested from the associated Research Workspace or from national archives upon stakeholder request. Examples include species abundance surveys and similar research efforts. 

The data catalog is built around a familiar search interfact, with several important elements arranged around the screen:

* Filter by location map in the upper left
* Groups of common tags to help filter the catalog quickly in the column on the left
* Text search bar across the top
* A list of datasets that match the desire criteria in the main column

Data Map
********

The data map interface provides interactive data exploration, mapping, and charting for visualizable layers available in the catalog. All real-time and near real-time data within the portal are accessible as interactive visualizations in the map view (as indicated with a map preview image in the catalog). Historical data are also accessible as interactive visualizations in the map, with the exception of datasets that may be published directly to the catalog from the Research Workspace.

The map is highly customizable (“Settings” and “Legend”), enabling deep exploration of the data. Advanced charting features allow users to view and summarize multiple datasets, and to create custom Data Views to compare data sources, bin by time, or plot climatologies and anomalies of timeseries datasets. Users can create and share custom compilations of biological, sensor, and model outputs to spotlight environmental events or geographic locations. 

The data map is built around a familiar interactive map interface, with several important elements arranged around the screen:

* Blue toolbar across the top
* Legend displayed on the right
* Grey time slider toolbar along the bottom
* Data display window in the bottom left corner
* Zoom navigation tools in the top left corner

Getting Started
***************

Follow these steps to get started using the portal.

Step 1: Find Data Layers
========================

1a) *Search the data catalog*. From the portal home page, click on 'Explore Data Layers' to navigate to the catalog.
  
1b) *Search for data*. Within the catalog, you will find a listing of all the data layers accessible through the portal. By default, they are in alphabetical order. You can browse by clicking on a category tag on the left, or by typing search terms in the search box in the upper left corner.
  
1c) *Learn more about the data layer*. By clicking on the title in the catalog, you will be taken to a metadata page that shows the URL to the source data, the data description, and any usage notes. There will also be an inset map where you can interactively explore the dataset as a single layer.  
  
Step 2: Display Data Layers
===========================
  
2a) *Select a data layer to add to the map*. Data layers can be viewed and explored in the interactive map. To add a data layer to a map, click the '+' icon from the metadata page or directly from the catalog. Then click on "Map" at the top right of the screen to be taken to the map.
  
2b) *Interact with the data in the map*. In the map, your selected layers will appear in a legend on the right. Using the gear icon, the map setting can be customized. As with other interactive maps, you can pan and zoom to adjust the view to your area of interest. Additionally, you can click on a data point of interest to open a chart that summarizes the data. A time slider at the bottom of the map can be used to step back and forth through time for timeseries data.
  
2c) *Search for more data to add to the map*. From the map, you can search for and add additional data layers to the map. Click on the "Catalog" button in top right to return to the catalog page you most recently visited. You can also search for additional data layers to add to the map using the search bar at the top left corner. When you have selected additional layers, click "Map" to return to the map.
  
Step 3: Download Data from the Portal
=====================================
  
3a) *Download vector data*. For vector data (e.g. lines, points, polygons) you can find a "Download data" button by scrolling to the bottom of the metadata page in the catalog. Format options include CSV, WMS, WFS, and Shapefile. Formats vary by dataset.
  
3b) *Download raster or gridded data*. For raster or gridded data (e.g. satellite, mobile sensors, models), you can download timeseries data from two locations: i) as described above, or ii) from the chart within the map, you can find a "Download data" link at the bottom of the graph.
