Add Layers
##########

There are multiple ways of adding data layers to the map.

From the Data Catalog
---------------------

1. From the `data catalog <http://help.axds.co/portals/DataCatalog.html>`_, browse or search for the layers you want to add.
2. On the results page, use the ``+`` icon next to any of the thumbnails, an indicator showing how many layers are currently queued will show up in the black, upper menu.
3. You can add multiple layers, it's just like a data "shopping cart".
4. Remove layers by selecting the layer indicator in the black, upper menu, and using the ``X`` icons.
5. After you are finished adding data layers, click ``Map`` in the upper toolbar to view those layers in the map.

From the Data Map
------------------

1. From within the interactive map, use the ``Search for data`` bar.
2. From the results popup, use the ``+`` icon next to the layer you want to add to the map.

Or, follow `these steps <http://help.axds.co/portals/DataCatalog.html#search-catalog>`_ for how to add data layers directly from the catalog.
