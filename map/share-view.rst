Once you've created, customized, and explored your data view, you'll probably want to share it with your friends and colleagues. To get a shareable link, follow these steps:

#. Click on the share button |share_button_icon| near the top right corner of the blue toolbar.
#. Highlight the link that appears in the popup window.
#. Copy that link and paste it anywhere you'd like to share it.

.. note::
	Anyone you share a view with will essentially see their own version of the view you have created and customized. Their edits and additions will not affect your saved view.
