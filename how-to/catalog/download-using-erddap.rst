Use ERDDAP

The Environmental Research Division Data Access Program (ERDDAP) is NOAA-sponsored software that builds a common data server providing access to gridded and device (e.g., weather sensor) data. ERDDAP servers provide access to some gridded data in a multitude of formats including CSV, TSV, htmlTable, json, .mat, and more. Each ERDDAP server has its own URL, but below is an example of how to access an example gridded dataset via the AOOS ERDAP:

#. Go to http://erddap.aoos.org
#. From the right-hand bar, search for Datasets by Protocol, select "griddap datasets" to see available layers
#. Select one of the available links under Grid DAP Data
#. Select the range in each dimension (e.g., start time, stride, end time), and uncheck all unneeded variables.
#. Select the output file type desired and submit the request to the server. When the data is bundled, it will download automatically.
