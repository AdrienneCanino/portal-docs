The catalog is built around a familiar interface of gridded data charts that match your search criteria presented in the center of the page. The charts show full-instrument time series data. In this view you can:

    #. Apply custom filters across all data charts using the Advanced Search toolbar. Refer to :ref:`Advanced Search Filters <advanced_search_filters>` section.
    #. Download data from an individual chart. Refer to :ref:`Downloading <download-how-tos>` section. 
    #. Download data from multiple charts using the download queue. Refer to :ref:`Queue Multiple Files for Download <download-queue-multiple-files>` section.
    #. Enlarge the data chart to further explore instrument data, including selecting the chart type, adjusting the time scale or time binning,  changing the chart scale, interacting with data quality flags, and adjusting the seasonal statistics (as applicable). Refer to :ref:`Customize Data Charts <search-project-data>` section.
    #. Add one or more data charts to a Data View to create, save, and share custom data comparison. Refer to :ref:`Data Views <how-to-data-views>` section.
