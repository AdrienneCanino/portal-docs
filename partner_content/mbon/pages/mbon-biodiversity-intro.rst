How Biodiversity Data Products are Created
------------------------------------------

Data displayed on the MBON portal are being displayed via the browser of the user. The data displayed are aggregated based on the focus and size of the map.

Calculating Biodiversity Indices
********************************

The following biodiversity indices are available for datasets that include sample/collection eventid and species identifier (scientific name, common name, ITIS TSN, or WoRMS Aphia ID). Indices are calculated at a local and regional scales (alpha and gamma diversity, respectively).

* **Richness:** The number of distinct species in a sample.
* **Dominance (Berger-Parker):** The numerical importance of the most abundant species.
* **Evenness (Pielou's):** A quantification of how equal the species counts are within a sample or region.
* **Shannon-Wiener Index/Diversity:** An index that accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present.
