Use Polygon Tool
################

To further interact with data in the map, the polygon tool can be used to create summary statistics across spatial areas of interest. To use the polygon tool:

#. Click on the polygon tool icon. Draw a polygon on the map around the area of interest using mouse clicks at each corner or bend in your shape. When you're finished drawing, double-click to complete the shape.

#. A data display window will open showing a summary chart of the data within the polygon. Beneath the data layer title at the top of the data display window, the number of observations contained within the polygon will be shown.

#. To delete the shape, click the "Trash can" icon next to the polygon tool.
