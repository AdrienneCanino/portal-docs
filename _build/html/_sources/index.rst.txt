Welcome to the documentation for the next gen portal. This portal is a data exploration tool developed by `Axiom Data Science <http://www.axiomdatascience.com/>`_ and shared among map-based portals of the `U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) <https://ioos.noaa.gov/>`_ and the `IOOS Regional Associations <https://ioos.noaa.gov/about/regional-associations/>`_.

The latest version of the portal offers many new and updated features that build upon existing data systems, including the following:

* Data comparison and charting functions

* Featured data scenario highlights
* Advanced charting features, including climatology and anomaly charts
* Station- and source-level metadata pages
