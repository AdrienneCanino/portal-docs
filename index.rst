.. only:: not ioos

	The |title| integrates datasets from many different sources. You can search or browse real-time conditions, operational and research forecasts, satellite observations, and other spatially referenced datasets that describe the regional biological, chemical, and physical characteristics.

	Datasets in the |title| can be interactively mapped or charted using advanced features, such as the ability to create comparisons between data sources, bin data by time, and plot climatologies and anomalies.

	Additionally, you can create and share custom compilations of sensor and model outputs to spotlight environmental events or geographic locations, access metadata and project contacts, and download datasets in a variety of formats.

	|title| Overview
	**********************
	The |title| is a data exploration tool with a customized public web interface that allows scientists, managers, and the general public to discover and access OOI data.
	Using the |title|, you can search or browse real-time conditions cabled, uncabled, and recovered data for in situ physical, chemical, geological, and biological observations.
 	Datasets can be interactively charted using advanced features, such as the ability to create comparisons between data streams, bin data by time, and plot climatologies and anomalies.
	Additionally, you can create and share custom comparisons of datasets to spotlight environmental events or geographic locations, access instrument metadata and provenance information, and download datasets in a variety of formats, including ERDDAP.

The |title| is being actively developed by `Axiom Data Science <https://www.axiomdatascience.com/>`_. For the notes about the latest portal version please visit: https://axiomdatascience.com/portal-updates/
