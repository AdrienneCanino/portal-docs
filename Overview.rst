Overview
########

The portal is built on a familiar interactive map interface, with several featured elements arranged around the screen:

* Blue toolbar across the top
* Legend displayed on the right
* Grey time slider toolbar along the bottom
* Data display window in the bottom left corner
* Zoom navigation tools in the top left corner

When you begin to explore the portal, it defaults to a zoomed-out view centered on the region. Hexagonal tiles that represent areas covered by sensors are layered over the basemap.

As with other interactive maps, you can pan and zoom to adjust the view to your area of interest. To pan, click and drag the map with your mouse pointer. There are 2 ways to zoom using icons in the top left of the screen:

#. You can use the plus/minus icons |plus_minus_icon|
#. Or you can use the magnifying lens icon |magnify_icon| to select an area of the map, which the viewer will then zoom to
