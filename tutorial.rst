Follow these steps to get started using the |title|.

Step 1: Find Data Layers
************************

1a) *Search the data catalog*. From the |title| home page, click on ``Explore Data Layers`` to navigate to the catalog.

1b) *Search for data*. Within the catalog, you will find a listing of all the data layers accessible through the |title|. By default, they are in alphabetical order. You can browse by clicking on a category tag on the left, or by typing search terms in the search box in the upper left corner.

1c) *Learn more about the data layer*. By clicking on the title in the catalog, you will be taken to a metadata page that shows the URL to the source data, the data description, and any usage notes. There will also be an inset map where you can interactively explore the dataset as a single layer.

Step 2: Display Data Layers
***************************

2a) *Select a data layer to add to the map*. Data layers can be viewed and explored in the interactive map. To add a data layer to a map, click the ``+`` icon from the metadata page or directly from the catalog. Then click on ``Map`` at the top right of the screen to be taken to the map.

2b) *Interact with the data in the map*. In the map, your selected layers will appear in a legend on the right. Using the gear icon, the map setting can be customized. As with other interactive maps, you can pan and zoom to adjust the view to your area of interest. Additionally, you can click on a data point of interest to open a chart that summarizes the data. A time slider at the bottom of the map can be used to step back and forth through time for timeseries data.

2c) *Search for more data to add to the map*. From the map, you can search for and add additional data layers to the map. Click on the ``Catalog`` button in top right to return to the catalog page you most recently visited. You can also search for additional data layers to add to the map using the search bar at the top left corner. When you have selected additional layers, click ``Map`` to return to the map.

Step 3: Download Data
*********************

3a) *Download vector data*. For vector data (e.g. lines, points, polygons) you can find a ``Download data`` button by scrolling to the bottom of the metadata page in the catalog. Format options include CSV, WMS, WFS, and Shapefile. Formats vary by dataset.

3b) *Download raster or gridded data*. For raster or gridded data (e.g., satellite, mobile sensors, models), you can download timeseries data from two locations: 1) as described above, or 2) from the chart within the map .You can find a ``Download data`` link at the bottom of the graph.
