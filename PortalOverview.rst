Portal Overview
###############

Welcome. These pages provide help documentation for the shared cyberinfrastructure that underlies several environmental data portals used by several different agencies across North America. These tools allow users to visualize, explore, and obtain datasets and are intended to aid in the availability, understanding, and reuse of that data. For simplicity, the help docs refer to this set of tools as the **data portal**. The data portal is being actively developed by `Axiom Data Science <http://www.axiomdatascience.com/>`_ in collaboration with several of its partner organizations and is currently in Beta status. Several new features are scheduled for release in 2018, as indicated in the text.

*****************************
Understanding the Data Portal
*****************************

The data portal is made up of a catalog and a map interface. The catalog provides a way to explore available datasets using text searches and filters, as well as the ability to download datasets of interest. Some datasets in the catalog can be visualized automatically through the data portal's map interface, which provides a rich suite of tools for creating charts, comparing data, and visualizing datasets in context.

*********************
Using the Data Portal
*********************

This section describes the basics of the data portal's catalog and map.

Data Catalog
============

The data portal features a data catalog, which provides a way to explore available datasets using text searches and filters, as well as the ability to download datasets of interest.

Data Map
========

The data portal also features a familiar interactive map interface, with several important elements arranged around the screen:

* Blue toolbar across the top
* Legend displayed on the right
* Grey time slider toolbar along the bottom
* Data display window in the bottom left corner
* Zoom navigation tools in the top left corner

When you begin to explore the portal, it defaults to a zoomed-out view centered on the region. Hexagonal tiles that represent areas covered by sensors are layered over the basemap.

As with other interactive maps, you can pan and zoom to adjust the view to your area of interest. To pan, click and drag the map with your mouse pointer. There are 2 ways to zoom using icons in the top left of the screen:

#. You can use the plus/minus icons |plus_minus_icon|
#. Or you can use the magnifying lens icon |magnify_icon| to select an area of the map, which the viewer will then zoom to
