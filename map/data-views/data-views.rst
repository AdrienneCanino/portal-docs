Data Views
##########

You can save a collection of data layers and visualize them together for comparison and analysis. These collections are called "data views," and they are accessed by clicking on the views button |views_button_icon| near the top right corner of the blue toolbar along the top of the window.

Within the portal there are several premade data views that highlight environmental events or locations of interest. You can access these premade views from the portal landing page or by following these steps:

#. Click on the views button |views_button_icon|
#. Select the view you'd like to access from the dropdown menu

The  view will open, displaying data comparion charts for you to explore. In the example image below, you can see the ``Hurricane Sandy`` view.
