NetCDF Subset
#############

The NetCDF Subset protocol looks through all the datasets NetCDF files stored on our server, and provides an human-readable or machine-readable interface to subset the data by time, geography, or variable.

#. Select "THREDDS NetCDF Subset" under the ``Download`` button to start the service.
#. Your browser will wait for a response from the server, which builds a library of all the files and metadata in the complete dataset so it can display up-to-date information.
#. The response page will have a list of available variables â€” check the variables you want to download.
#. Subset the dataset by latitude and longitude, and time range with a stride (the default  stride is 1, which downloads all time slices; a stride of 2 will download every second time slice, etc.) Add lat/lon variables if needed in your output, but in most cases this is unnecessary.
#. The output format will be a single NetCDF file that contains the complete dataset.

.. tip::
	When you initially request a dataset via NetCDF Subset, the server may take a long time to respond if dataset is large (i.e., thousands of files). Be patient, it's not broken! If your web browser times out (e.g., after 10 minutes of waiting), you can try reloading or just giving it a few more minutes and then reload. This won't restart the server process, and once it's indexed all the files things will go pretty fast.

.. note::
	All THREDDS servers have a bandwidth limit, and it will not allow you to download more than the cap in one go. So you won't be able to download 1 Tb of data with a single request. If you need a lot of data, you will need to break up your requests to download the dataset incrementally (e.g., one month at a time; one variable at a time, etc.). If you're grabbing a lot of data programmatically, sometimes it's easiest to grab just one time slice at a time using a loop.
