Time Slider

The time slider bar at the bottom of the map allows you to view temporal data. The time intervals available will vary depending on which data layer you are viewing. The bar is unavailable if there is not any time-enabled data layers loaded. By default, the time slider is set to display the most recent data that is available for that data layer.

.. tip:: For quick reference, the time range for data being viewed in the map is shown in the right-hand map legend beneath the data layer title.

The temporal extent for the data layers can be viewed by hovering your mouse over the time slider control. The name of the data layer, the begin and end dates for the data, and a line graph of the temporal range will appear. The temporal information will appear for all time-enabled datasets that are currently loaded in the map.

There are several ways to interact with temporal data.

#. Click and drag both the time slider control to the right and left to step through the temporal data interactively. Or, click and drag both ends of the time slider control to adjust the time bounds. Then, click and drag the middle of the time slider control bar to step through the temporal data. For finer control of the time slider, pull down on your mouse while dragging. Hover your mouse over the time slider bar to see the temporal range of the data that has been selected.

#. Click on the gear icon to the left of the time slider for finer time controls. The bounding time interval can be entered by clicking the calendar bar. Using the calendar, enter a custom range by selecting both the start and end dates from both calendars. Or, click the preset time ranges from the list on the left to view real time, past 24 hours, past week, past 30 days, etc. Select ``Apply`` to view the selected time range of data in the map.

#. Click on the gear icon to open the time control menu. Select the ``Next Time Stamp`` button to step forward to the next time stamp. For example, if the data view has been set to show data from the prior month, the next time stamp would advance to show data from the current month. Click the ``Previous Time Stamp`` buttom to step back to the previous time stamp. To show the full start or end time extent click on the ``Step Forward`` or ``Step Backward`` to move the time control to the full start or end extent.
