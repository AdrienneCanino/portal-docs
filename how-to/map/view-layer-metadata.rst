Within in the map, there are several ways to learn more about the data layer being displayed.

#. In the map legend to the right, you may see the ``i`` icon next to the data layer title. Click on it to view the metadata page.
#. Click on a point in the map. A data display window will appear showing a chart of the data. In the bottom right of the chart click on ``Source``. You will be directed to the data provider's webpage, if available.
#. For real-time sensor data, click on the station in the map. A data display window will appear showing a chart of the data. Here you have two options:

	* **Station and Source Pages:** In the bottom left of the chart you can click on ``Station``. Summary information about the station will be shown, including the instrument location, temporal coverage, platform type, station URN or WMO ID, and the source information for the data provider. Interactive data charts for each of the sensors associated with that station will be shown on the right hand side. You can interact with these similar to other `data charts <http://help.axds.co/portals/DataMap.html#data-charts>`_. Under Sources, you can click on the name of the data provider to discover a list and links to all stations available in the map from that provider.

	* **Sensor page:** In the bottom left of the chart you can also click on ``Sensor``. Summary information about the sensor will be shown, including parameter information, temporal coverage, and the sensor and parameter source URNs. Under parameter information, you can click the ``Download`` button to download the sensor data. You can also interact with the summary data chart for that sensor.
