Submitting and Formatting Data

Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) observation data is focused on organisms from microbes to whales, including measures of biodiversity (e.g. presence, abundance), productivity, genomics, phenology, and other relevant ecological process measurements or indices.

Biological data in MBON are formatted according to Darwin Core ENV-DATA Application Profile maintained by OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System). This format calls for occurrence, event and measurement-or-fact tables. More details can be found in the `OBIS manual <https://obis.org/manual/dataformat/#emof>`_.

For information about how to format and contribute biological data for the Data Portal, visit: `MBON Data and File Formatting <https://ioos.github.io/mbon-docs/index.html>`_.
