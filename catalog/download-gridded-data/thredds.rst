Thematic Realtime Environmental Distributed Data Services (THREDDS) is a set of services provided by `Unidata <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/TDS.html>`_ that allows for machine and human access to raster data stored in NetCDF formats. THREDDS provides spatial, vertical, and temporal subsetting, as well as the ability to select individual dimension or data variables to reduce file transfer sizes. The most commonly used THREDDS services for AOOS users are NetCDF Subset, and Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OpenDAP).
