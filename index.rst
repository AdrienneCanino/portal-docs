Introduction
------------

These pages describe the next-generation sensor map developed by Axiom Data Science for the `U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) <https://ioos.noaa.gov>`_, which was released on September 1, 2017. The so-called "next-gen" sensor map offers many new features and makes it even easier to explore, analyze, and download data from the extensive IOOS sensor network.
