Data Layers
###########

Once you have found a layer through the data catalog, you can view and interact with the data in a number of ways. As with other interactive maps, you can pan and zoom to adjust the view to your area of interest. Additionally, you can click on a data point of interest to open a chart that summarizes the data. A time slider at the bottom of the map can be used to move back and forth through time for timeseries data. More information about these features is provided below.
