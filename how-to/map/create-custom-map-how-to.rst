**There are two ways to get started creating a custom map.**

Custom Map Option 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. From the home page, click the ‘Create custom map’ button.  

    #. Enter the bounding coordinates for your site in decimal degrees (using positive east) as: Northwest Latitude, Northwest Longitude, Southeast Latitude, and Southeast Longitude. This will draw the farm site on the map. Or, you can skip this step and use the drawing tools within the map to approximate your farm site (refer to Option 2 below).
    #. Enter a description to appear in the map legend box. (Note: the description text can be edited before printing the map). The legend box should include:  

        * Figure No and Map Type (General location, Detailed location, Site plan) 
        * Applicant Name (Business Name)
        * Waterbody
        * Area/Region
        * Today's Date  

        For Example:

        * FIGURE 1   Detailed Location Map
        * Alaska’S Best Oysters
        * Jerryton Bay
        * East of Prince of Wales Island, Southeast AK
        * December 18, 2020

    #. Select the map type you are creating from the drop down menu. Refer to Required Maps for Joint State Agency Application, and USACE Permit Application on the `Siting Information website <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Adl6b_97CXbuGJxapUUP8yIooLoX7UDJ0gRs6YgrVo/edit%23heading%3Dh.b9w6oydob1&sa=D&ust=1608510533730000&usg=AOvVaw3qT73D5gLVdnUBHvK6PLQH>`_  for map descriptions.
    #. After you select the map type, you will be redirected to the main map. 
    #. Refer to the Default Data Layer section for more about the default data layers that are added to each of the map types (i.e. General Location, Detailed Location, Site Plan).
