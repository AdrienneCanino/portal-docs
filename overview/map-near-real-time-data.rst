Near-Real Time Data
###################

Near real-time data are ingested by the |title| at the same frequency that the data are made available; however, there is some delay (hours to days) between data collection and when the data provider makes it available. Examples of near real-time assets include model outputs, satellite images, and derived satellite products.

Model and Satellite Data
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Model outputs or satellite imagery have been visually abstracted in the portal to include a schematic representation of the data attributes or variables. The variable currently being displayed is shown as a title in the right hand legend bar. The variable being displayed can be changed by clicking the caret icon and selecting from the other variables that may be available (note: the variables available will vary depending on which data layer you are viewing). The current date and time for the data being displayed is shown in the right hand legend bar beneath the data layer title.

To select your area of interest, use the pan and zoom features on the map. To display values within your area of interest, hover your mouse over the map. The name of the data layers, latitude/longitude, date, time, and the value at the given location will appear. If you click on the map in any location covered by a multi-dimensional model or grid, a data chart window showing the data trends over time will appear. More information can be found in the `Data Charts <http://help.axds.co/portals/DataMap.html#data-charts>`_  section of this document.

The timer slider bar at the bottom of the map can be used to view the various time intervals of data available. The interval available will vary depending on which data layer you are viewing. More information about using the time slider can be found in the `time slider <http://help.axds.co/portals/DataMap.html#interact-with-and-customize-data-layers-in-the-map>`_ section of this document. Depending on your zoom level and internet speed, these time intervals layers could take awhile to appear so be patient as these layers load. Once you do have them in the cache they will load more quickly as you step forward and backwards through the time.

The data layer legend on the right hand shows the color scale that is used to represent the unit of measurement. You can change the palette and scale settings by clicking on the color bar. Select among the different color palettes using the drop down menu. The legend scale can be changed by either adjusting the scale slider, or by clicking on the gear icon and entering or advancing the bounds control interval. When the map is zoomed in, the scale and color for that area can be automatically set for the data in view by clicking the `Autoset for data view` button.
