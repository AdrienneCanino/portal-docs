The catalog provides search access for all datasets within the |title|. The catalog can be used to discover, browse, and download data files. Additionally, the catalog can be used to add visualizable data layers to the map. The catalog contains several observational data types:

* *Real-time data* are ingested, served, and displayed by the portal at the same frequency the data are collected (and sometimes reported) by the originator with little to no delay. Examples of real-time assets include weather stations, oceanographic buoys, and webcams.

* *Near real-time data* are ingested by the portal at the same frequency that the data are made available; however, there is some delay (hours to days) between data collection and when the data provider makes it available. Examples of near real-time assets include satellite images and derived satellite products.

* *Historical data* are data that are one month old or older. Historical data are ingested from the associated `Research Workspace <http://help.axds.co/portals/DataCatalog.html#data-files-from-the-research-workspace>`_ or from national archives upon stakeholder request. Examples include species abundance surveys and similar research efforts.
