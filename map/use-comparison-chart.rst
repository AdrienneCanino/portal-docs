Comparison Chart
################

Comparison charts appear below the map and allow you to plot similar data from different sources. To add data from a saved chart to a comparison chart, follow these steps:

#. Click the |data_display_view_icon|.
#. Click the ``Add to compare chart`` box under your view's name.

The new data will appear in the comparison chart in a contrasting color, and the name of the data layer will also be added to a list below the comparison chart.

.. note::
	Comparison charts have the same options for displaying data as saved charts, which are described above under **Displaying Your Data**.
