If there are more than three years of data coverage for stations or gridded data, charts on the portal show statistics from past weather patterns along with the current data. These are not officially climatologies, which typically require 30 years of data, but they can still be useful to quickly compare how the current year fits into the data that's available at a station.

Historical patterns in station observations
===========================================

1. From the real-time sensor map or historical sensor map, click on any station that has more than three years of data.
2. The default graph will show binned data, with the dark gray line indicating the mean and the gray envelope representing the min and max values within the current year.


Historical patterns in gridded data
===================================

1. Clicking on any gridded dataset will open a :ref:`gridded-data-overview`.
2. If the dataset has more than three years of data, the default graph will show binned data.
3. The dark gray line indicating the mean and the gray envelope representing the min and max values within the current year.
