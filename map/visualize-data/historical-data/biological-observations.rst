Biological Observations

*These features and more will be explored more thoroughly in upcoming updates to this documentation.*

Data from most research-based biological observations are aggregated into hexagonal bins to visually summarize data over a large spatial area when the map is zoomed out. This means that data from more than one location or observation may be displayed within a hexagon. The color of the hexagon represents the average value of the selected data parameter within that hexagon. For example, if count or abundance is the selected parameter, then the hexagon color will reflect the average count of all individuals or observations within that bin.

To view a summary of all the observation data contain within a hexagon, hover over the hexagon. A window will appear showing the summary of all observations by parameter. Additionally, the time range for which those values were measured will be shown. If you click on the hexagon, a data display window will appear showing a histogram chart summarizing the data. The number of locations or observations aggregated within that hexagon will appear below the parameter name in the data display chart.

To view data for an individual location or observation, zoom in on the map. The hexagons will soften into points that represent the individual sample locations or observations that were aggregated into that hexagon. To view current readings from that location, hover over its point. As shown in the image below, a pop-up window will display some basic information, including the observation or location name, latitude and longitude, and a summary of events or observations by parameters (e.g., count by species, percent abundance, number of events, etc ).

To change the data parameters in the map, the filters can be used in the legend on the right side. You can select among the measurements that are available using the caret, or by toggling on/off the checkboxes. The exact filters or measurements available vary by the data layer being shown.

To further interact with the data in the map, the `polygon tool <http://help.axds.co/portals/DataMap.html#interact-with-and-customize-data-layers-in-the-map>`_ can be used to create summary statistics across spatial areas of interest. Or, the `time slider <http://help.axds.co/portals/DataMap.html#interact-with-and-customize-data-layers-in-the-map>`_ bar can be used to view the various time intervals of data available.

If when zoomed in the hexagons do not soften into points, the individual locations or observations have been intentionally aggregated for data use or confidentiality purposes.

To view location data, click on the point. Data from that location will appear in the data display window in the lower left corner of the window. You can use the dropdown menu in the data display window to select different parameters for that location (if available), or you can use the time slider to adjust the time period of the data.
