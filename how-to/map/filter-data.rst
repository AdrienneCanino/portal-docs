Filter Data
###########

In the map, your selected layers will appear in a legend on the right. The filters in the legend can be used to change the parameters on the map. You can select among the measurements that are available using the caret, or by toggling on/off the checkboxes. The exact filters or measurements available vary by the data layer being shown.

Toggle Layers On/Off
--------------------

Individual data layers can be toggled on and off using the``Eyeball`` icon to the right of the data layer name. To delete the data layer from the map, select the ``X`` icon.

Change Layer Order
------------------

The order in which data layers appear in the map can be changed. By default, the data layer that appears at the top of the map legend will be displayed forward in the map. To move data layers backward in the map, select the ``Up/Down Arrow`` to the left of the data layer name.

Customize Color and Scale
-------------------------

The data layer legend on the right hand side shows the color scale that is used to represent the unit of measurement. You can change the palette and scale settings by clicking on the color bar. Select among the different color palettes using the drop down menu. The legend scale can be changed by either adjusting the scale slider, or by clicking on the gear icon and entering or advancing the bounds control interval. When the map is zoomed in, the scale and color for that area can be automatically set for the data in view by clicking the ``Autoset for data view`` button.
