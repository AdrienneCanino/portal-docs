This portal is a data exploration tool with a customized public web interface that allows scientists, managers, and the general public to discover and have access to public data from many sources. Within the data portal, users can search or browse real-time conditions, operational and research forecasts, satellite observations, and other spatially referenced datasets that describe the regional biological, chemical and physical characteristics. Data in the portals can be interactively mapped or charted using advanced features such as, comparisons between data sources, binning by time, and plotting of climatologies and anomalies. Users can create and share custom compilations of sensor and model outputs to spotlight environmental events or geographic locations. Using the portal, users can access metadata and project contacts, as well as download data in a variety of formats.
