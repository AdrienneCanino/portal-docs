Overview
########

The portal is built on a familiar interactive map interface, with several featured elements arranged around the screen:

* Blue toolbar across the top
* Legend displayed on the right
* Grey time slider toolbar along the bottom
* Data display window in the bottom left corner
* Zoom navigation tools in the top left corner

When you begin to explore the portal, it defaults to a zoomed-out view centered on the Americas. Hexagonal tiles that represent areas covered by sensors are layered over the basemap.

As with other interactive maps, you can pan and zoom to adjust the view to your area of interest. To pan, click and drag the map with your mouse pointer. There are 2 ways to zoom using icons in the top left of the screen:

#. You can use the plus/minus icons |plus_minus_icon|
#. Or you can use the magnifying lens icon |magnify_icon| to select an area of the map, which the viewer will then zoom to

To view current readings from a sensor, hover over its hex. As shown in the image below, a pop-up window will display some basic information about the sensor, including its name, agency affiliation, lattitude and longitude, current readings, and available variables (e.g., air temperature, water level, and water temperature as in the example below).

To see a time series of data from a sensor, click on its hex. As shown in the image below, data from the sensor will appear in the data display window in the lower left corner of the window. You can use the dropdown menu in the data display window to select data from different variables collected by the sensor, and you can use the time slider to adjust the time period of the data.
