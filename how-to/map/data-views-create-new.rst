While the premade data views are interesting, the real fun starts when you begin making and sharing your own views. To do so, follow these steps and consult the GIF below:

#. If you're not in the map view, click on the map button |portal_button_icon| to get there.
#. Zoom and pan to your desired map view.
#. Click on the point that represents the data you're interested in.
#. Its data will show up in the data display window in the bottom left corner of the window.
#. Within the data display window, click on the |data_display_view_icon|.
#. To add the data to an existing view, choose it from the dropdown menu. Or, to create a new view, click on the add icon |add_view_icon|.

In the GIF below, we've zoomed in on Hawai'i and selected a sensor to view. We then added that sensor's data to a new view called "My view."
