	Ocean gliders are autonomous underwater vehicles used to collect ocean data, including temperature, salinity, conductivity, and other important measures. Unlike stationary sensor platforms such as buoys, gliders move through the water column and collect data at different locations over time.

	.. note::
		For more information on gliders, see NOAA's `"What is an ocean glider" <https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ocean-gliders.html>`_ page.

	Glider data can be visualized by accessing it from a data catalog. Here's an example of how to visualize glider data from the Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS) data portal:

	#. Go to the CeNCOOS `data portal <http://dev.axiomdatascience.com/?portal_id=20#search?tagId=Gliders>`_.
	#. Filter the catalog by selecting ``Gliders`` tag from the list on the left.
	#. This will display a list of glider datasets collected off the coast of California.

	To visualize the dataset, click on its name. In our CeNCOOS example, to visualize the first dataset on the list, follow these steps:

	#. Click on `UCSC260-20150520T0000 <http://dev.axiomdatascience.com/?portal_id=20#search?tagId=Gliders>`_.
	#. Wait for the dataset to load.

	Once the dataset has loaded, you should see the view in the image below:

	From here there are several ways to explore the glider dataset:

	#. overlaid on imagery on the upper-left,
	#. described by basic metadata on the lower-left,
	#. displayed in a 2-dimensional plot on the upper-right, and
	#. plotted in a 3-dimensional plot on the lower-right.

	Additionally, the dataset can be downloaded in several different formats by using the blue downloads button in the top right |glider_data_download_icon|.
