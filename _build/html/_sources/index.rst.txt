Introduction
************

Welcome to the documentation for the beta version of the next generation Environmental Sensor Map (ESM). The ESM integrates regional, national, and global real-time (past 4-hours) data from observing systems operated by `U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) <https://ioos.noaa.gov>`_, `IOOS Regional Associations <https://ioos.noaa.gov/about/regional-associations/>`_, and local data providers. This map offers many new updated features that build upon existing data system, including the following:

* Data comparison and charting functions
* Customizable data sharing among users
* Featured data scenario highlights
* Advanced charting features, including climatology and anomaly charts
* Station- and source-level metadata pages
* Data dashboards created from user selections

You can navigate these help pages using the links below or in the black sidebar on your left. If you have a question that is not answered, please contact us via the red Feedback button |feedback_button_icon| in the top right corner of the ESM page. Your feedback will help us improve this documentation for later users!
